# Issue tracker: Local Markdown

Issues and PRDs for this repo live as Markdown files in `.scratch/`.

## Conventions

- One feature per directory: `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`
- The PRD is `.scratch/<feature-slug>/PRD.md`
- Implementation issues are `.scratch/<feature-slug>/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`
- Triage state is recorded as a `Status:` line near the top of each issue file.
- Comments append under a `## Comments` heading.

When a workflow calls for publishing or retrieving an issue, create or read the corresponding `.scratch/` file.
